## What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?

Hello everyone :moyai:

This challenge gave me some headache from looking at the design because i saw some inconsistency in term of spacings between certain elements. Anyway, i picked a rock and ate it (not really, should i pick a frog?).

:seedling: **Built with**

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML
- Pure CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

:memo: **What i have done**

- Made the solution as close to the design as possible (i don't have Figma files).
- Added custom effects on interactive elements (spice things up).

## What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?

The challenge was there, but i overcame it anyway.

## What specific areas of your project would you like help with?

Would love to hear your opinions on any topic.
